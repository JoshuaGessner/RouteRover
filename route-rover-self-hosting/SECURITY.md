# Security Features & Best Practices

## Built-in Security Features

### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- Script tags and javascript: protocols are stripped
- Zod schemas validate all API inputs

### ✅ Authentication Security
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Secure session cookies (HttpOnly, Secure in production)
- 7-day session expiration

### ✅ Rate Limiting
- General API rate limiting: 100 requests/15min (production)
- Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts/15min
- File uploads: 10 uploads/5min
- Per-IP tracking with automatic blocking

### ✅ Security Headers
- Helmet middleware with Content Security Policy
- XSS protection headers
- Clickjacking protection (X-Frame-Options)
- Content type sniffing prevention

### ✅ File Upload Security
- File type validation (images only)
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Path traversal protection
- Secure file naming and storage

### ✅ SQL Injection Prevention
- Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
- No raw SQL execution
- Input validation before database operations

### ✅ CORS Protection
- Configurable allowed origins
- Credentials support for trusted domains
- Production-ready CORS settings

## Production Security Checklist

### Required Configuration
- [ ] Set strong SESSION_SECRET (32+ random characters)
- [ ] Configure ALLOWED_ORIGINS for your domain
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production
- [ ] Set secure DATABASE_URL

### Recommended Practices
- [ ] Regular dependency updates (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Set up log rotation
- [ ] Use firewall to limit port access
- [ ] Regular database backups
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Implement log aggregation
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Use Redis for session storage (high traffic)

## Environment Variables Security

```bash
# Required - Keep secure
SESSION_SECRET="minimum-32-character-random-string"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db"

# Optional API keys - Keep private
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Production settings
NODE_ENV="production"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"
```

## Security Incident Response

1. **Monitor Logs**: Check for unusual patterns
2. **Rate Limit Violations**: Block abusive IPs
3. **Authentication Failures**: Monitor failed login attempts
4. **File Upload Issues**: Check for malicious files
5. **Database Errors**: Monitor for injection attempts

## Regular Maintenance

### Weekly
- Review application logs
- Check for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor disk usage (uploads directory)

### Monthly
- Update dependencies (`npm update`)
- Review security logs
- Check for CVEs in dependencies (`npm audit`)

### Quarterly
- Rotate SESSION_SECRET
- Review user accounts
- Update PostgreSQL if needed
- Security audit of custom code

## Common Vulnerabilities Prevented

| Vulnerability | Protection | Status |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| XSS | Input sanitization + CSP | ✅ Protected |
| SQL Injection | Drizzle ORM + validation | ✅ Protected |
| CSRF | SameSite cookies + CORS | ✅ Protected |
| Clickjacking | X-Frame-Options | ✅ Protected |
| Path Traversal | File path sanitization | ✅ Protected |
| Brute Force | Rate limiting | ✅ Protected |
| File Upload | Type/size validation | ✅ Protected |
| Session Hijacking | Secure cookie settings | ✅ Protected |
